# [PREDICTING MOVIE REVENUE (IMDB)](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data)

*See template.ipynb for a fresh notebook to code in ;-)*

### Given a data set of the 1,000 most popular movies on IMDB in the last 10 years, can you predict the revenue of a given movie?

### Questions/Exercises:

**1.** Download the data programatically with python. 

(**Hint:** To generate your own kaggle.json file go to *your profile* -> *account* -> *Create new API Token*, and then place the file it in ~/.kaggle/)

<hr/>

You will now have to make a train-test-split of the data so that you have a way of verifying the model later. (We suggest 2/3 for training and 1/3 for testing)
	
Here is a link to the [train-test-split documentation for sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html)

**2.** Fit the training-data into a model, present it visually and reflect on wether it is a good fit or not.

<hr/>

**3.** Now take the test-data, test the model and evaluate how accurate the model is.

### Review Questions:
1. Was the data downloaded programatically with python?
2. Was the training-data fitted into the model, presented visually and reflected on?
3. Was the model tested with the training data, and was the accuracy of the model evaluated?
